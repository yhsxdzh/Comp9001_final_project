# Comp9001_final_project
My final project is a mini-game called 24-point calculation.

To run this program, please put all files into a folder and run the 'main.py' file.
There will creat a file called 'high_score.txt' to record the highest history score.

This project is a mini-game called '24-Point Calculation', which stimulates an easy poker card game.
The purpose is to use 4 given numbers (1-10 inclusive) and apply basic arithmetic operations(+,-,*,/ with optional parentheses) 
to form a valid expression that equals 24.

It has three modes:
1. Speed Challenge Mode:
A 60-second time limit.
Players must determine whether the given numbers can be formed to 24 or not.
Earn 10 points for each correct answer, but lose 15 points for incorrect attempts.
The goal is to get maximal score under time pressure.

2. Casual Mode:
Players freely use given 4 numbers to calculate 24.
The game ends when players want to quit.

3. Check Mode:
Players can enter 4 numbers to check if it is valid.

and

4. help
Give players some instruction for better understanding.
